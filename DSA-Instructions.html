            <h1>What is an Algorithm?</h1>
            <article>
                An algorithm is a process or a set of rules required to
                perform calculations or some other problem-solving
                operations especially by a computer. The formal definition
                of an algorithm is that it contains the finite set of
                instructions which are being carried in a specific order to
                perform the specific task. It is not the complete program or
                code; it is just a solution (logic) of a problem, which can
                be represented either as an informal description using a
                Flowchart or Pseudocode.

            <h1>Characteristics of an Algorithm</h1>
            <article>
                <strong><em>The following are the characteristics of an
                        algorithm:</em></strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Input:</strong> An algorithm has some input
                        values. We can pass 0 or some input value to an
                        algorithm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Output: </strong>We will get 1 or more
                        output at the end of an algorithm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unambiguity:</strong> An algorithm should
                        be unambiguous which means that the instructions in
                        an algorithm should be clear and simple.</li>
                    <li><strong>Finiteness: </strong> An algorithm should
                        have finiteness. Here, finiteness means that the
                        algorithm should contain a limited number of
                        instructions, i.e., the instructions should be
                        countable.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Effectiveness:</strong> An algorithm should
                        be effective as each instruction in an algorithm
                        affects the overall process.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Language independent:</strong> An algorithm
                        must be language-independent so that the
                        instructions in an algorithm can be implemented in
                        any of the languages with the same output.</li>

            <h1>Approaches of Algorithm</h1>
            <strong><em>The following are the approaches used after considering both the theoretical and practical
                    importance of designing an algorithm:</em></strong>
            <article>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Brute force algorithm:</strong> The general logic structure is applied to design an
                        algorithm. It is also known as an exhaustive search algorithm that searches all the
                        possibilities to
                        provide the required solution. Such algorithms are of two types:
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Optimizing:</strong> Finding all the solutions of a problem and then take out
                                the
                                best solution or if the value of the best solution is known then it will terminate if
                                the
                                best solution is known.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sacrificing:</strong> As soon as the best solution is found, then it will stop.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Divide and conquer:</strong> It is a very implementation of an algorithm. It allows you
                        to
                        design an algorithm in a step-by-step variation. It breaks down the algorithm to solve the
                        problem
                        in different methods. It allows you to break down the problem into different methods, and valid
                        output is produced for the valid input. This valid output is passed to some other function.</li>
                    <li><strong>Greedy algorithm:</strong> It is an algorithm paradigm that makes an optimal choice on
                        each
                        iteration with the hope of getting the best solution. It is easy to implement and has a faster
                        execution time. But, there are very rare cases in which it provides the optimal solution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic programming:</strong> It makes the algorithm more efficient by storing the
                        intermediate results. It follows five different steps to find the optimal solution for the
                        problem:
                        <ol>
                            <li>It breaks down the problem into a subproblem to find the optimal solution.</li>
                            <li>After breaking down the problem, it finds the optimal solution out of these subproblems.
                            </li>
                            <li>Stores the result of the subproblems is known as memorization.</li>
                            <li>Reuse the result so that it cannot be recomputed for the same subproblems.</li>
                            <li>Finally, it computes the result of the complex program.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Branch and Bound Algorithm:</strong> The branch and bound algorithm can be applied to
                        only
                        integer programming problems. This approach divides all the sets of feasible solutions into
                        smaller
                        subsets. These subsets are further evaluated to find the best solution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Randomized Algorithm:</strong> As we have seen in a regular algorithm, we have
                        predefined
                        input and required output. Those algorithms that have some defined set of inputs and required
                        output, and follow some described steps are known as deterministic algorithms. What happens that
                        when the random variable is introduced in the randomized algorithm?. In a randomized algorithm,
                        some
                        random bits are introduced by the algorithm and added in the input to produce the output, which
                        is
                        random in nature. Randomized algorithms are simpler and efficient than the deterministic
                        algorithm.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Backtracking is an algorithmic technique that solves the problem
                        recursively and removes the solution if it does not satisfy the constraints of a problem.</li>
